# Languages & Phrases

vBulletin's language system allows you to localize your site in languages other than US English without editing any templates or files. The vBulletin phrase system makes its templates language independent so you can display pages in multiple languages using a single style. Each phrase (for example, “password” or “one hour ago”) can have a translation for every language specified in this Language Manager. When a channel page is loaded, vBulletin checks what language the current logged-in user has selected, looks up the phrase variables in that language, and replaces them with the appropriate translated text. In addition to translated phrases, vBulletin's language system supports translated images (by allowing you to override a style's images folder setting), and language-specific date/time/number formats. 

The topics in this section cover what you need to know to localize your vBulletin site.

## Master Languages

Regardless of any languages you enable as administrator (for example, Spanish or German) there are always two that always exist in vBulletin: the Master Language and the Custom Master Language. These are generally protected from being directly edited. The Master Language is where all of vBulletin’s untranslated, default phrases exist. It is important to have the original version of all phrases available for reference purposes. You cannot directly edit these language phrases. The Custom Master Language contains only custom phrases you have created, which can be accessed as if they were part of the Master Language.
