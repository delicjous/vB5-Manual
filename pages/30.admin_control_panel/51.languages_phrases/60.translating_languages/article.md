title: Creating Language Translations
---

To begin translating a language, click [process]Languages & Phrases|Language Manager|click [link]Edit / Translate <language name> Phrases[/link][/process]. This will take you to a page that looks like this:
[fig]language/language_translate.png[/fig]

This page contains a list of phrases for the language. On the left is the phraseâ€™s variable name; on the right are the default value (top) and the translated value (bottom). If a phrase has not been translated yet, the default value will be in the bottom as well.

Once you have translated a page, simply click [button]Save[/button]. Any phrases which have changed will be saved and used in this language. To do a complete translation, repeat this process for each page of every phrase group.
