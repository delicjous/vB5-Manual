The Language Manager allows you to add and delete new languages to your site. Each user can choose the language they wish to use.

This screen lists all languages you have installed. Next to each language you can find links for various controls to manage your languages.

- Edit / Translate: Opens the Phrases Manager and allows you to edit the translations of individual phrases.
- Edit Settings: Allows you to edit the settings of the language. Settings include the character set and locale as well as date, time, and currency formats.
- Delete: Removes the language from your vBulletin site. Any users that have this language selected will be switched to the default language.
- Download: This lets you download a language set as an XML file. This file will contain all phrases that have been translated for that language. After downloading the XML file can be shared with other vBulletin owners for uploading to a new installation.
- Set Default: This button allows you to set a language as the default for your site. The default language is shown to registered users who did not select a language at registration, and to unregistered users or those who are not logged in.

After the language list section there are links that let you search for phrases, view a language quickref, or rebuild all languages.

At the bottom of the screen are buttons to add a new language and download or upload existing language sets.
