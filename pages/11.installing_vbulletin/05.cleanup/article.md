Once the installation process is complete, and you will be presented with a link to your Admin Control Panel. Before clicking this link, you should open up your FTP client application again and browse to the ___/core/install/___ folder inside your %forumroot% directory.

Once you have deleted this folder you can return to the installer script and click the link to enter the Administrator Control Panel of your freshly installed vBulletin!
